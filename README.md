# XXXL Tech Radar

At [XXXLutz], we maintain a [public Tech Radar](https://xxxlutz.github.io/tech-radar/) to help our engineering teams align on technology choices. 

This is a Fork from the project from [Zalando Tech-Radar Projekt](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar).
Is is based on the [pioneering work by ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).

## Usage
As a working example, you can check out `docs/index.html` &mdash; the source of our [public Tech
Radar](http://zalando.github.io/tech-radar/).
