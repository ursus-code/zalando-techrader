        JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language
        with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but
        it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm
        scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional
        programming styles. It is the only programming language that runs natively in browsers.

        It has become our library of choice for building user interfaces on the web.

        With the increasing complexity of single-page JavaScript applications, we have seen a more

        testability story: Dispatching actions, state transitions and rendering can be unit-tested
        separately from one another and with minimal amounts of mocking.

It allows developers to write ES6+ code that runs in the browser or on the server without sacrificing backward compatibility for older browsers, and with very little configuration. It has first-class support for different build-and-test systems, which makes integration with any current workflow simple. It is a great piece of software that has become the main driver of new language feature adoption and innovation.
