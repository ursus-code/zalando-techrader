It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It is the only programming language that runs natively in browsers.",

Its minimal library design has spawned a rich set of tools, and we encourage you to check out the <a href="https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links">redux-ecosystem-links</a> project for examples, middleware and utility libraries. We also particularly like the testability story: Dispatching actions, state transitions and rendering can be unit-tested separately from one another and with minimal amounts of mocking.`,

It has first-class support for different build-and-test systems, which makes integration with any current workflow simple.
