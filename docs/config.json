Unlike traditional state management libraries, React Query works directly with data fetching operations, handling automatic caching, background fetching and automatic updates without need for boilerplate code.</p><p>When to use: This library is best suited for managing backend data that requires minimal manipulation on the client side. Additionally, React Query can be used in conjunction with other state management solutions to handle server state, while leveraging different libraries for client state as needed.</p><p>Used in Platform and Pollpass</p>"
