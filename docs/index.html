<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The GWI Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale. Technologies with a usage culture in our GWI production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some engineers in our organization walked this path and will share knowledge and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping effort.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
The primary aim of the Tech Radar is to spread knowledge about the technologies actively in use at GWI, supporting engineering teams in choosing the most effective tools for their projects. It serves as a platform for sharing experiences and insights into different technologies, reflecting on technology decisions, and continuously evolving our technology landscape. Based on the <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a>, our Tech Radar highlights changes in technologies that are significant in software development &mdash; changes that we believe our engineering teams should be aware of and incorporate into their projects.
</p>
  

<h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

<p>
Currently, our Tech Radar is at the evaluation stage, so it is maintained by our FE chapter leadership team. The Tech Radar is open for contribution for all engineering teams at GWI and depends on their active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.<br/>
